C# day2:
Let’s imagine that we want to build a program that manages all of the inventory in a shop.​

We’d like it to​
Know how many of each item we have in stock​
Allow a customer to add items to a basket (and then purchase all the items)​
Allow the manager to order new stock​
Produce a report of the stock and what got sold in the last week.​
